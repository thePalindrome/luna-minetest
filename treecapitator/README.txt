[13.04.2015] Added in trees for moretrees, working out getting proper naming for capitating to work.

﻿[14.03.2015] Added sound of a falling tree (taken from there http://www.freesound.org/people/ecfike/sounds/139952/). Made "drop_items" and "drop_leaf" both "true" by default. (mintpick)

TODO:
— add more trees
— add more types of trees
— play sound if much nodes are removed
— use vector_extras' functions to increase speed
— update loop(s)
