To Do:

-add random_volume parameter to night normal, day normal, & cave normal sounds to create feeling of distance.

m-get constant birds more quiet during the day
m-bats seem way too frequent now?
m-when playing multiplayer seems to increase frequency of music & normal sounds to the point where they are obnoxious
m-which songs should go with which environments?   Dark songs in caves or night, light sounds during day.
m-may be drowning out some of the normal sound effects like walking on stone.
l-what about other weird bubble 
l-put in wind/ wind in trees during day and night
